in 1st opamp read the output by DMM and keep it around 21.5mV

next opamp keep output reading around 245 with short ckt tck then connect tck and then calibrate...........

donot forget to  boiled water test for QC pass


UPDATE:
1at Opamp gain: 21.36 times (res val: Rf=2.2k and Ri=47k) Noninverted without input resistance
2nd Opamp gain: 100 times (res val: Rf=1k and Ri=100k) Noninverted with 1k input resistance

in 1st opamp read the output by DMM and keep it around 30mV

next opamp keep output reading around 300 with short ckt tck then connect tck and then calibrate...........

donot forget to  boiled water test for QC pass
